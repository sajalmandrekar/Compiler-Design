# Compiler Design

## Course Objectives

-   The subject aims to provide the student with:
    -   To understand the basic principles of compiler design
    -   To know the major steps involved in translating a high-level programming language down to a low-level target machine language
    -   To understand the relationship between machine and assembly language, compilers, interpreters, linkers, loaders, assemblers and macro preprocessors
    -   To construct efficient algorithms for compilers

## Course Outcomes

-   The Student will be able to:
    -   CE710.1: Understanding the basic structure and working principles of various components and phases of compiler.
    -   CE710.2: Illustrate automation compiler construction process using tools
    -   CE710.3: Justify the role of parser in compiler design.
    -   CE710.4: Demonstrate the code generation and code optimization techniques.
